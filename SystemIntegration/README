This system integration was divided into two subsystems, namely ANN Selection and ANN Decision.
ANN Selection is used for the initial selection of ships that commit illegal fishing or transhipment. The output from ANN selection will be used as the input of ANN Decision.
ANN Decision was divided into two subsystems, namely ANN Decision Transhipment and ANN Decision Fishing. ANN Decision Transhipment is used for the final identification of illegal transhipment ships and ANN Decision Fishing is used for the final identification of illegal fishing ship.
