Code for my project: illegal fishing and transhipment identification

In this project, I designed system integration with predictor for identification of illegal fishing and transhipment based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.
Predictor in this project was designed using recurrent neural networks (RNN). This predictor is used to predict the missing AIS data that contains information about position, heading, and speed of ship during the cruise.
System integration in this project was designed using artificial neural networks (ANN). This system integration is used to identify ships that commit illegal fishing and illegal transhipment.
